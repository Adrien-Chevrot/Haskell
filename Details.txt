This zip file contains 6 different directories, one for each version described in the dissertation.

In each directory, there is 2 scripts for launching the program on the Robotarium cluster,
the first one is tboruvka.sh for measuring runtimes only, and the second one logboruvka.sh is useful
to create an eventlog file, which can be used with the tool 'threadscope' to get the GC percentage.

Source codes from each version can be compiled using:
ghc -O2 -rtsopts -threaded -o boruvka_thr boruvka.hs

You will need ghc installed on the Linux machine to compile and run the programs.

Parallel measurements can be run using:
time ./boruvka_thr C1000.dat +RTS -N6

-N6 is the number of cores you want to use.
The best option to get parallel measuremets is to run the program
on the Robotarium Cluster using:
sbatch tboruvka.sh C1000.dat 16
It will indicate to the system that the program must be launched using the longq, with the C1000.dat file
and 16 cores to compute.

The 'mstgraph2.dat' file represents the graph that we took as an example in the dissertation
from 'http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-9-boruvkas-algorithm/'
